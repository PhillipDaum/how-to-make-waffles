# How to Make Waffles 
This is a short, fun, and interactive course on waffle making. 

## Description
The course is built in Articulate Storyline 360, and hosted on GitHub Pages. It incorporates some fun drag and drop interactions used in creative ways. It also has a feature to generate a certificate of completeion using jsPDF.

The Certificate was made using LaTeX, and later exported as a .png. I was unable to find a suitable API for compiling LaTex.
